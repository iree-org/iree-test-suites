### Example LLaMa Model with Toy Implementation

The LLaMa example contained is a random initiated model with 3 layers. The
motivation is to have an executable version of the model to validate both
compilation and numerics of execution. This is generated using using sharktank
with the default coefficients. Future updates for the `mlir` file should
maintain the same `irpa` values while only updating the executed code.
